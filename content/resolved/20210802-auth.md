Sporadically, a process on our authentication servers fails, 
causing user logins to fedora applications to fail until restarted. 
We are investigating this issue. Please see the ticket below and in particular:

Sorry for any trouble.

We worked with upstream sssd developers to track down this sporadic and
difficult to debug issue. Finally they found a reference count issue that
might well have been causing this. We updated to a version with a test fix
for this issue on 2021-09-30 and haven't seen the problem since then. 

Users still seeing any authentication problems should file new tickets
and we will assist in tracking those down.

Many thanks to SSSD developers and our users for their patience.
