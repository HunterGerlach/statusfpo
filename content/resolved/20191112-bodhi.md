We will be upgrading bodhi to its 5.0 release. This release comes in with few UI changes 
but also task scheduling system (rabbitmq/celery based) allowing to offload some of the 
tasks currently performed in the front-end to distributed workers. This should results 
in the users experiencing a faster bodhi in some requests.
