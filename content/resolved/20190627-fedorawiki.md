We will be updating the nodes running mediawiki to Fedora 30 and thus also 
upgrading mediawiki to a newer version. The last scheduled upgrade was 
aborted due to some issues found in staging. These issues have been fixed 
and we are ready to finally upgrade.
This outage impacts the [Fedora Wiki](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki).
