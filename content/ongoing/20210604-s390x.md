The facility hosting the fedora s390x builders has a site wide
power outage scheduled for June 4th to June 6th. We will be
powering off these builders at 22UTC on 2021-06-04.
It's likely that they will be back sometime late in the day of 2021-06-05,
but it could be they are not back until 2021-06-06.
During this time any builds that build against s390x will stall
in 'free' state until the builders are back.
No rawhide composes will be done in the outage window.
