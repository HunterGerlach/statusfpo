We're updating Copr servers from Fedora 33 to Fedora 35. The copr-backend
storage (Copr build results) will stay mostly online during this outage but some
downtime is expected.

This outage impacts the
[copr-frontend](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org)
and the [copr-backend](https://copr-be.cloud.fedoraproject.org/).
